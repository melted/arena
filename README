This is an arena allocator written in C. It reserves space in preallocated 
chunks for small objects, while large allocations are handled one by one. 
This gives minimal overhead while avoiding having to reserve a large memory
area that will never be used. This allocator uses 16KB chunks and allocations
smaller than 4KB are handed out from chunked memory.
